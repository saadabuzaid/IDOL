# IDOL: Image eDiting tOoL
### This project was done by team 8 Java in Large scale software and Extreme programming at University of Essex.(2021-2022)
#### Project Requirements:

* IDOL can load an image into the GUI, allows a range of
transformations/edits and then saves the transformed image.
* Inversions, rescaling, rotations, conversion to black and white, and a
few other transformations (e.g., blurring, edge sharpening) etc. should
be made available to the user.
* Ideally adding text labels, drawing, highlighting, and cropping should
also be implemented
* Colour map transformations should also be available.
* Also, saving in different image format could be available.
##### If time allows:
* IDOL should have an infinite “undo” function
It should have a macro recording or scripting mode thought which a
sequence of transformations can be replayed on a different image.
